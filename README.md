### Known issues

Duplicate Transactions when using`-y` or `--ynab_date`

> YNAB has a bug where if you previously import transactions containing the date in one syntax, and then import a csv with a different date syntax, YNAB will consider them as different transactions. (Even if they are identical in every other way)

Workaround:

> Open the CSV file and change the dates to match the format that your bank normally uses (e.g YYYY/MM/DD), or don't use the -y option
